Report issues privately to the maintainers with:
- A description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

Maintainers will acknowledge reports promptly and provide status updates as fixes are developed.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release on the default branch is considered supported for security fixes.
